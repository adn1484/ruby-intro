# To run this code, be sure your current working directory
# is the same as where this file is located and then run:
# ruby 3-arrays.rb

# Arrays are lists of things
foods = ["tacos","pizza","ice cream"]
puts foods
p foods

numbers = [4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42]
puts numbers

mixed_array = ["tacos",3, true]
p mixed_array


# Accessing the array

puts numbers [0]

# Add to the array

puts mixed_array.append ("salad")


# There are lots of fun things you can do with arrays:
