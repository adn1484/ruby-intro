# In Ruby, there are different *types* of data:

# Numbers
puts 3
puts 2
puts 3  / 2.0
puts 2 + 2
puts 3 * 2

# Perform simple math with numbers

# Strings
puts "Hello"

# Combine strings together
puts "Hello " + "world"
puts "Tacos" * 3

# Variables
code = "Ruby is a very good language to learn code"

puts code + " for beginners"

# Combine strings and variables

puts "#{code}, to you"

# String manipulation

puts code.upcase
